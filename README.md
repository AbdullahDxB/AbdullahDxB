# Hi there, I'm Abdullah Ajmal 👋

I’m an Electronics and Communication Engineering undergraduate at **MNNIT Allahabad**, specializing in **Digital System Design (RTL)**, **Embedded Firmware**, and **Mixed-Signal PCB Design**.

I am transitioning from system-level integration to low-level hardware engineering, with a focus on solving complex problems in the semiconductor and embedded domains.

## 🚧 Current Engineering Sprint (Dec 2025 - Jan 2026)

I am currently undergoing an intensive **Hardware Design Cycle**, focusing on bridging the gap between schematic design and physical layout, and advancing from combinational to sequential logic design.

| Project Focus | Tooling | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RTL Design & Verification** | Xilinx Vivado, Verilog | 🟡 *Building Core Modules (Counters/FSMs)* |
| **Custom PCB Development** | Altium Designer | 🟡 *Schematic Complete, Layout in Progress* |
| **Bare Metal Firmware** | STM32, ARM Cortex | 🔴 *Planned* |
